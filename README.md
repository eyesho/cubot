# Cubot

Cubot is a machine designed to solve Rubik's cubes automatically. This repository contains the software code for the machine, which was modified from the qbr repository(https://github.com/kkoomen/qbr) on GitHub.

## Usage

Cubot is fully automated, and all you need to do is place your Rubik's cube on it and press a button. The machine's technical details are available in the doc folders, and the entry point is `gui.py`.

If you encounter any problems while using Cubot, please reach out to me at rootby@126.com.

## Demo
