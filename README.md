The software part of Cubot was modified from the qbr repository on GitHub. If you encounter any problems, please reach out to me at rootby@126.com. Cubot is fully automated, and all you need to do is place your Rubik's cube on it and press a button. The machine's technical details are available in the doc folders, and the entry point is gui.py.
